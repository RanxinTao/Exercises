/**
 * Given an array of elements, reorder it as follow:
 * { N1, N2, N3, ..., N2k } -> { N1, Nk+1, N2, Nk+2, N3, Nk+3, ..., Nk, N2k}
 * { N1, N2, N3, ..., N2k+1 } -> { N1, Nk+1, N2, Nk+2, N3, Nk+3, ..., Nk, N2k, N2k+1}
 * Try to do it in place.
 * 
 * Assumptions: 
 * 1. input, S and T are not null
 * Examples:
 * 1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} -> {1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6}
 * 2. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} -> {1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8}
 * 3. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} -> {1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 7}
