 * Given an array of positive integers representing a stock's price on each day. On each day you can only make one 
 * operation: either buy or sell one unit of stock, at any time you can only hold at most one unit of stock, and you
 * can make at most 2 transactions in total. Determine the maximum profit you can make.
 * 
 * Assumptions: 
 * array is not null and has length >= 2
 * 
 * Examples:
 * {2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 11}, the maximum profit you can make is (5 - 1) + (11 - 2) = 13
 * 
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
